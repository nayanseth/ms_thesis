# Real Time Cross Platform Collaboration Between Virtual Reality & Mixed Reality

Virtual Reality (hereafter VR) and Mixed Reality (hereafter MR) have opened a new line of applications and possibilities. Amidst a vast network of potential applications, little research has been done to provide real time collaboration capability between users of VR and MR. The idea of this thesis study is to develop and test a real time collaboration system between VR and MR. The system works similar to a Google document where two or more users can see what others are doing ie writing, modifying, viewing, etc. Similarly, the system developed during this study will enable users in VR and MR to collaborate in real time.

# Code

Code consists of two Unity projects:

1. Vive - for VR
2. Hololens - for MR

The app allows a user in VR and MR to learn how to assemble a chair in real-time.
